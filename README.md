## Installation & Building

### Prerequisites

[**.NET 9.0 SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0): This is needed, and is the only dependency you need to really install.

### Build instructions

This is the same across most os.

**Step one**: Clone the repository or download it via the page.
(Note: git is required to clone it.)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TBG09/ShrimpleCmdReborn.git
```

**Step two**: Change your directory into it.
```bash
cd ShrimpleCmdReborn
```

**Step three**: Build the project either in Debug or Release, replace <configuration> with either of these.
```bash
dotnet build --configuration <configuration>
```

It should be built to bin/<configuration>/ as ShrimpleCmd.exe(or as an elf depending on your platoform).
